## Component Composition Techniques

When designing complex interfaces, proper component composition is essential. Here are some effective techniques:

```xml
<!-- Example of component composition -->
<xamlds:XDSCard>
    <xamlds:XDSCard.Header>
        <xamlds:XDSCardHeader Title="User Information" />
    </xamlds:XDSCard.Header>
    <xamlds:XDSStack Spacing="Medium">
        <xamlds:XDSTextField Label="Name" />
        <xamlds:XDSTextField Label="Email" />
        <xamlds:XDSButton Content="Save" HorizontalAlignment="Right" />
    </xamlds:XDSStack>
</xamlds:XDSCard>
```

## Performance Considerations

When designing reusable components, consider these performance aspects:

1. **Visual Tree Complexity**: Keep the visual tree depth manageable
2. **Resource Management**: Use StaticResource over DynamicResource when appropriate
3. **Virtualization**: Implement UI virtualization for collections
4. **Binding Optimizations**: Reduce binding count and complexity
