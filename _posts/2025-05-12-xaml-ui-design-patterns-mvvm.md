## Benefits of MVVM

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between user interface and business logic
- **Testability**: Easier to write unit tests for ViewModels without UI dependencies
- **Designer-Developer Workflow**: Designers can focus on the View while developers work on ViewModels
- **Code Reuse**: ViewModels can be reused across different Views

## Implementing MVVM with XamlDS.ITK

XamlDS.ITK provides built-in support for the MVVM pattern through various base classes and utilities:

```csharp
// Sample ViewModel implementation using XamlDS.ITK
public class MainViewModel : XDSViewModelBase
{
    private string _title;
    public string Title
    {
        get => _title;
        set => SetProperty(ref _title, value);
    }
    
    private ICommand _submitCommand;
    public ICommand SubmitCommand => _submitCommand ??= new XDSCommand(ExecuteSubmit);
    
    private void ExecuteSubmit()
    {
        // Command logic
    }
}
```
